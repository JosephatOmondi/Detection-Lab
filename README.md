# WIRESHARK

## Objective

The Wireshark project aimed to create a comprehensive environment for network traffic analysis and troubleshooting. The primary goal was to utilize Wireshark to capture, dissect, and interpret network packets, providing insights into network behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and security threats. This hands-on project was designed to enhance proficiency in network security analysis, protocol analysis, and incident response strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in capturing and analyzing network packets using Wireshark.
- Understanding of network protocols and their behavior in real-world environments.
- Ability to identify and troubleshoot network issues through packet analysis.
- Recognition of common network attack patterns and signatures.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in network security analysis.

### Tools Used

- Wireshark for capturing, dissecting, and analyzing network packets.
- Additional network analysis tools to complement Wireshark's capabilities.
- Packet generation tools for simulating network traffic and attack scenarios.
